# Google Voice for Python #

This project aims to bring the power of the Google Voice API to the Python language in a simple, easy-to-use manner. Currently it allows you to place calls, send sms, download voicemails/recorded messages, and search the various folders of your Google Voice Accounts.
You can use the Python API or command line script to schedule calls, check for new received calls/sms, or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.
Works for Python 2 and Python 3

Special thanks goes out to [Chad Smith](http://posttopic.com/topic/google-voice-add-on-development) for posting his knowledge of the API. Some of the python code was adapted from [his Firefox addon](http://thatsmith.com/2009/03/google-voice-add-on-for-firefox/).

Documentation and example code is available [online](http://sphinxdoc.github.com/pygooglevoice/) and provided in the [extras package](http://pygooglevoice.googlecode.com/files/pygooglevoice-0.5-extras.zip)
